            Arsenal was the first club from the South of England to join the
            Football League in 1893, and they reached the First Division in
            1904. Relegated only once, in 1913, they continue the longest streak
            in the top division,[6] and have won the second-most top-flight
            matches in English football history.[7] In the 1930s, Arsenal won
            five League Championships and two FA Cups, and another FA Cup and
            two Championships after the war. In 1970â€“71, they won their first
            League and FA Cup Double. Between 1989 and 2005, they won five
            League titles and five FA Cups, including two more Doubles. They
            completed the 20th century with the highest average league
            position.[8] Between 1998 and 2017, Arsenal qualified for the UEFA
            Champions League for 19 straight seasons.[
