    <li><b>HTML</b></li>
    <p>The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. </p>
    <p>It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript. </p>
    <p>Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. </p>
    <p>HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document. </p>
    <li><b>CSS</b></li>
    <p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML.</p>
    <p> CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.[</p>
    <p>CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts.</p>
    <li><b>JS</b></li>
    <p>JavaScript (/ˈdʒɑːvəskrɪpt/),[10] often abbreviated JS, is a programming language that is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS.</p>
    <p>Over 97% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for web page behavior,[12] often incorporating third-party libraries.</p>
    <p>All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on users' devices. </p>
    <li><b>React JS</b></li>
    <p>React (also known as React.js or ReactJS) is a free and open-source front-end JavaScript library[3] for building user interfaces based on UI components.</p>
    <p>It is maintained by Meta (formerly Facebook) and a community of individual developers and companies.</p>
    <p>React can be used as a base in the development of single-page, mobile, or server-rendered applications with frameworks like Next.js. </p>
